To read input string through command line arguments and create a table with keywords and count.

## Compile:
gcc -o aniket_hw1 aniket_hw1.c

Replace keywords with string you want and replace file with your file.

## Description:
Here we have created counter data type so which we can use throught out the program.
Here argv is used to store keyword and argc is the counter for keyword. 'i' is the loop variable.
